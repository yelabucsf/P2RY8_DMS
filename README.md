# P2RY8_DMS

This repository contains scripts used in the P2RY8 deep mutational scanning work, as described in:
TN LaFlam, CB Billesbolle, et al. Phenotypic pleiotropy of missense variants in human B-cell confinement receptor P2RY8. 2025. Submitted. 

Included files: 
- Sequencing analysis scripts, using BBTools and GATK 
- R script for z-score calculation
- Jupyter notebook for ESM1b fine-tuning and one-hot-encoding ridge regressions
- R script for additional DMS analysis and for those figure plots made in R 

File names begin with number indicating approximate order of use (some elements of 7 required to perform 6)

Sequencing files used in this analysis have been deposited in SRA under BioProject PRJNA1179413 and are publicly available as of the date of manuscript publication.
